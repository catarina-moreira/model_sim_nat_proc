# Week 1. Introduction and Background Concepts

## Module 1. Objectives and Background

### What is a model?

A model is a representation of reality or part of reality, but not of the full system. 

- Simplified abstration of reality (or part of it, but never the full system) allowing us to better describe it and understand it;
- Ans abstraction in which only the essential ingredients are retained, according to the question we ask about the question;
- It is the representation of a phenomena in a mathematical or computer-based language;

## Module 2. Modelling and Simulation

### Why do we need a model?

- Describe, classify, understand, predict and control some representation of reality

### Levels of Reality

Whenever we are dong modelling, we need to take into consideration a certain level of reality in a sense that according to a scale at which you want to describe a given process. 

You should adapt your model level to the question and the scale it to which you want to answer your problem. 

It is not always easy to identify these important ingredients and to indentify hoe these ingredients mutually interact. That is whay domain knowledge is important: you need it to understand the relationships between the main ingredients of your model.
